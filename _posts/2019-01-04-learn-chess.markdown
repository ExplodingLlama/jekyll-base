To better myself at chess is one of my cherished goals. This game has the right amount of depth to it. There are elements of strategy: you have to identify a plan, stick to it, pivot to a new one as the situation demands. There are elements of sacrifice, sometimes you need to give away your pieces to gain some intangible benefit.
To be better and executing plans and figuring out the best tactic in a position, we need to hone our skills of understanding the position properly.
We need to notice, at a glance, all the necessary information to assess the position. What is this information? What aspects of a chess position are the most important? We have a few obvious ones: Undefended pieces, open lines, pawn structure etc.
We need a way to hone these skills through exercises. Going through tactic trainers is one broad way to improve some aspects. But I believe that we can go much finer than that. We can tackle one specific ability and hone it using repeated practice.
To kickstart such an initiative, the pilot project is to create a minigame of undefended pieces: In 5 minutes, go through as many random chess positions from actual games and mark all the undefended pieces for each position for both colours.
The best place to do it in is lichess code base, which is opensource. This project is mostly a programming challenge to create such a game and make a pull request to the main lichess project.
